# The Horse Market
*A polished singleplayer breeding and management game built in Unity.*

## Overview

**The Horse Market** is a feature-rich singleplayer horse breeding and management game built with Unity.  
The project began as a small experiment inspired by *Wynncraft’s* (Minecraft Server) simple horse upgrade mechanic — combining two lower-tier horses for a chance at a higher tier.  
It has since evolved into a **complete standalone experience** with:

- **8 Horse Tiers**
- **41 Unique Traits**
- **Complex Inheritance and Mutation Algorithms**
- **Competitions, Training, and Trading Systems**
- **Lootbox-Style Acquisition**
- **Prestige & Ascension Progression System**

The result is a surprisingly deep, system-driven tycoon/idle-style game — fully playable, polished, and designed to feel rewarding over multiple sessions.
